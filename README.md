# Airport-Sim: SYST 230 project
Authors:
Noah Farley, Markus Garretson, and Khang Nguyen

# What to expect:
This simulation is used to better understand how airports funcation depending on the amount of planes being serviced.

# How to use:

# cell 1: #run first
Used to import and initailize starting variables.
# cell 4: #run second
Used to initailize all functions and classes.
# simluation ready
# cell 3: #run third
9 total tests: 3 for 10, 20, and 30 planes.
It is multible copys of cell 2 because turning cell 2 into a funcation broke the simulation.
graphs the results
# cell 2: #one simulation
Used to run one simulation
