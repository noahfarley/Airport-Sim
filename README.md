# Airport-Sim

# SYST 230 project
# Authors:
# Noah Farley, Markus Garretson, and Khang Nguyen

# What to expect:
# This simulation is used to better understand how airports funcation depending on the amount of planes being serviced

# How to use:
# cell 1: #run first
#    used to import and initailize starting vars
# cell 4: #run second
#    used to initailize all functions and classes
# simluation ready
# cell 3: #run third
#    is multible copys of cell 2 because turning cell 2 into a funcation broke the simulation
#    9 total tests: 3 for 10, 20, and 30 planes
#    graphs the results
# cell 2: #one simulation
#    used to run one simulation
